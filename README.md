### Even an apology needs a roadmap.

This project provides an interactive implementation of the **REPAIR Protocol**—a step‑by‑step process for acknowledging harm, planning amends, and rebuilding trust. The single page application (`Index.html`) includes enhanced cognitive tools, progress tracking, and a printable reconciliation contract.

## Features

- **Guided Workflow** – Navigate through eight structured phases:
  1. Assessment
  2. Recognize
  3. Examine
  4. Prepare
  5. Articulate
  6. Implement
  7. Restore
  8. Contract
- **Dynamic Stepper** – Visual progress indicator with active/completed states.
- **Local Data Storage** – Information is saved in your browser's local storage so you can return later.
- **Contract Generation** – Automatically create a detailed agreement summarizing all entered information with options to download, copy, view, or print.
- **AI Coach Integration** – After signing, follow the provided link to connect with a dedicated REPAIR Protocol AI coach for continued guidance.
- **Progress Dashboard** – Metrics and status indicators appear once the contract is signed.
- **Graceful Icons** – Navigation arrows display using simple characters if the Feather Icons CDN fails to load.
- **Celebratory Animation** – A heart halves join and lock together after signing the contract, reminding you to scroll down for AI options.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Index.html` in a modern web browser. No additional server is required.
3. Work through each phase, filling out the forms and navigating with the **Next** and **Previous** buttons.
4. After completing all phases, review and sign the generated contract. Export or print it for your records.

All data stays on your machine unless you choose to share or upload the contract.

## Development

The entire application is contained in `Index.html`. HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript are used—no external build tools are required. Edits can be made directly in that file. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
